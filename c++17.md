# C++17

## Standar Attribute

An attribute is an additional information that can be used by
- the compiler to produce code (for optimization or some specific code generation). 
- other developers to give more information about code.

Before C++11, each compiler introduced its own set of annotations, usually with a different keyword.

### C++11 attributes

- `[[noreturn]]` : It tells the compiler that control flow will not return to the caller.
- `[[carries_dependency]]` : Indicates that dependency chain in release-consume std::memory_order propagates in and out of the function, which allows the compiler to skip unnecessary memory fence instructions. 

### C++14 attributes
- `[[deprecated]] and [[deprecated(“reason”)]] :` ndicates that the name or entity declared with this attribute is deprecated, that is, the use is allowed, but discouraged for some reason. 

### C++17
- `[[fallthrough]]`: Indicates that the fall through from the previous case label is intentional and should not be diagnosed by a compiler that warns on fallthrough. 
- `[[maybe_unused]]` : Suppresses compiler warnings about unused entities.
- `[[nodiscard]]`:  Can be applied on a function or a type declaration to mark the importance of the returned value.
